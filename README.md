# credit-risk-classification
Mod 20 Challenge 


The purpose of this particular anaylsis was to design a machine learning model that would be able to predict the odds of a loan being either healthy or high risk based on a multitude of factors relating to loans including but not limited to: Loan size, interest rate, borrows income and total debt. In this specific dataset that was being analysed the loan status, which was the target variable, was binary whereby healthy loans and highrisk loans where classed by either a 0/1 respectively. There are different stages involved in the machine learning process, it started off with data loading where the csv is loading into a Pandas DataFrame, then the data gets examined and the types of each column was checked. The data was then split into the labels (y-variable) and the features (x-variables). The data was then split into test and training sets. A logisitc regression model was trained using the training data. The model made predictions on the testing set and then a confusion matrix and classfication report was produced to evaluate the model. The main machine learning process used in this anaylsis was a logistic regression model. A logigstic regression model can usually assist with predictions on classifying binary data.
